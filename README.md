# Machine Learning Aided Video Processing

## Project overview
This repository contain set of tutorials on how to make use of Machine Learning 
models to aid video processing.

The tutorials are intended to be self-contained and ready to be run on Google 
Colab where everyone is able to run the code for free with GPU support.

Provided tutorials are divided into topics represented by first level of 
directories structure.


## Tutorials content
### Semantic Segmentation
Tutorial on how to use a Deep Learning model to infer on video stream. The model
is built on the basis of [ICNet architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08545),
whole model definition code and weights are provided. In 
[attached notebook](semantic_segmentation/SemanticSegmentationOnVideoWithICNet.ipynb) 
there is example on how to wrap the model and execute inference on video stream.
